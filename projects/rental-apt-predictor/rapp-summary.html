									Apartment-hunters in Tokyo may find themselves overwhelmed as they generally lack information to make informed decisions.
									Most importantly, it is difficult to know if they are getting a fair price.
									Thus, I have made an end-to-end solution to predict a Rental Apartment Prices- scraping data on over 200k rental apartments in Tokyo, training and ML Model, and deploying it through a user friendly web app.

								<h2>The Problem</h2>
									<p>
									I personally have rented three apartments while living in Japan, 
									and while one would like the best apartment for the best price, each time I remember thinking that the customer is at a clear disadvantage.
									<!-- The first apartment, I was new to Japan and my company found a place for its new workers. 
									The second apartment,  I had to move across the country to Tokyo for a new job and was limited in time, knowledge, and ability to do phyiscal viewings.
									The third apartment, I had ample time, and knowledge to leverage in my search. -->
									Each time, I had more knowledge and language ability to leverage in my search.
									For the greatest advantage, each time I moved I also spent more time and effort to find the best deal.	
									<p>
									<b>
										Despite this, or maybe due to this, I noticed constantly that I, the consumer was at an overwhelming disadvantage when it came to finding a good price for the following reasons.
									</b>
									</p>


									<dl>
										<dt>1. The customer has unequal access to information.</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>In other words, the customer has access to only a portion of information, which is difficult to analyze. 
												You may have access to whatever listings are shown on company websites/apps.  
												These are generally posted by agencies.  However - and this will be discussed in a separate post - there is another database only accessible by those in the industry which has data on all the listings.  
												Thus, the demand side - consumer always has less information than the supply side - agents, management companies, and owners.
											</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>2. The customer is generally working under a mid-high level of stress, and time constraints.</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>While it is sometimes possible to "hold" your spot as first to sign the contract,
												it is not uncommon for agents or managements companies to impose strict timelines for decisions.
												Not only that, but life happens.  In these times searching every website, every area, and gathering all the data is optimal, but unrealistic.
												Consumers generally do not have enough information to make truly informed decisions.
											</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>3. Thus, the customer has little to no bargaining power.</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>
												In economic terms, Tokyo is an environment of near perfect-competition.  
												Meaning that there is a match between supply and demand of apartments.  
												Thus, there is little room for negotiation in price.  
												At least, this is what the agents and management companies all said.  
												Due to this lack of transparency, it is difficult to know if an individual should even attempt negotiations.
												If the listing is truly a fair price then trying to bargain, or wait comes with a risk.  
												Owners have little incentive to deal with problematic individuals.</p>
										</dd>
									</dl>




									<p>
					
										I hope to alleviate this information imbalance in understanding rental apartment prices through this work.

							<div class = "solution">
								<h2>End-to-End Solution</h2>
								<p>
								I hoped to alleviate the above problem statement by giving more information to the consumers with this app.  
								By analyzing large amounts of apartments throughout Tokyo, 
								I have aggregated a large amount of data, making self anaylsis possible.  However, this is already available on some of the larger sites.
								</p>
								
								<p>
								Thus, I also built a Machine Learning Model which can predict the monthly rent price of an apartment.  
								</p>

								<p>
								By inputting information related to a general apartment description, or a specific apartment you are looking at, an individual can gain insight into a fair rental price to use while apartment-hunting, or potentially during negotiation.<br>
								</p>

								<p>
								As the whole point of this work is that consumers do not have access to the full amount of information, I also had to start from zero, and create an end-to-end solution.<br>
								</p>
								
								<ol>
									<li>
										First, <b>I created a Web Scraper to get the data</b>. At the time of creation, I could not find a nice database API.  
										There were some which had only limited information, and those which had more detailed information did not work for me. 
										However, part of this exercise was to learn web scraping, so I built a web scraper to search for Tokyo Apartments across all areas 
										(not just limited to the 23 Wards) of Tokyo from publicly accessible websites.
									</li>  
									<li>
										Second, <b>I had to clean the raw data to create a useful dataset</b>.  
										One of the large problems came from the fact that these postings are not pulled directly from the centralized database, but made by individual agents.  
										Despite websites having a specific format, there was a high variance in the inputs, <b>ie. mistakes</b>.  
										This required a fair bit of cleaning to make sure all properties had correct features.  
										<!-- One of the more interesting findings was two listings over 100 years old.  
										One seemed purely a mistake, as the ‘Construction Date’ was 111/1/1.  
										However, the other listing had a reasonable input date, which led me to looking at some very interesting pictures. -->
									</li>
										<span class="br"></span>
										Another problem is how to treat stations, as listing prices in Tokyo are heavily influenced by not only the area, but also the specific station. 
										 Creating a set of pure Dummy Variables is one idea, but there are over 80 Lines alone, each having on average of 10-20 stations.  
										 This results in potentially inefficient overhead and is a point of consideration throughout the work.</li>
									<li>
										Third, <b>it was time to train the ML Model</b> after cleaning the inputs, and creating the dataset.
											This part was fairly straight forward, testing out a handful of linear/tree based models, then optimizing the parameters.
										
									</li>
									<li>
										Fourth, <b>I created a web app to allow users to input their specific features</b> – such as nearby station, type of apartment, etc.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</div>


							<div class = "future">
								<h2>Future Work</h2>
								<p>
								To increase model performance there are two main tasks that I can immediately foresee.
								<ol>
									<li><b>Get more data</b> - improve my web scraping pipeline and implement it over a period of time.
										This is especially important as Tokyo has not only 23 Wards, but areas beyond that.
										Similarly, there are over 80 Train Lines, and hunreds of individual stations.
										I have included all of these in the scope of the model, but they play a large role in the price of an apartment, and ensuring each area has sufficient data requires much more work.
									</li>
									<li><b>Re-work Features</b> - related to the above, there are a variety of ways to handle the cateogrical variables in this work.
										The real problem comes from the sheer amount of classes in each variable, and the fact that they cannot be simply encoded to continuous variables.
										I am in the process of trying various datasets, and experimenting which has the most efficient outcome.
									</li>
